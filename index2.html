                    <p>Elite Elephants is a collection of digital artworks (NFTs) running on the Polygon network. This website is only an interface allowing participants to exchange digital collectibles. Users are entirely responsible for the safety and management of their own private Polygon wallets and validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval. Furthermore, as the Elite Elephants smart contract runs on the Polygon network, there is no ability to undo, reverse, or restore any transactions.</p>

                    <h2>OWNERSHIP</h2>
                    <p>i. You Own the NFT. Each Elephant is an NFT on the Polygon blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying Elephant , the Art, completely.

                    <p>ii. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Elite Elephants Industries grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely forthe following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Elephant / NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Elephant owner’s rights to display the Art for their Elephant to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Elephant, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Elephant owner’s rights to display the Art for their Elephant to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Elephant leaves the website/application.</p>
                    <p>iii. Commercial Use.

Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of Elephants generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Elephant owner’s rights to display the Art for their Elephant to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of Elite Elphants  generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each Elephant owner’s rights to display the Art for their Elephants to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased Elephant leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.</p>
